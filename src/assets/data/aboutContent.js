export const aboutMe =
  "Hello, my name is Lindsey Jackson and I am a frontend developer with full-stack experience. I am passionate about creating intuitive and visually appealing websites and web applications that provide a seamless user experience. My goal is to create efficiencies in everyday life by outsourcing tasks to web applications.\n\nI approach design with a user-centered mindset, always keeping the user's needs and goals at the forefront of my decisions. I understand the importance of human psychology in design and incorporate this understanding into my work. This includes using color psychology, layout principles, and following predictable standards to guide the user's attention and evoke emotions. When creating a user flow or interface layout, I aim for a logical and efficient order for users to complete tasks or access information, resulting in a seamless and intuitive experience.\n\nGathering feedback from users is an important aspect of my development process. I enjoy learning from user feedback and using it to improve the applications I create. I believe that working with a diverse group of people, from other developers to designers and project managers, leads to the best results. Collaboration and open communication allow for new perspectives and ideas to be shared which in turn results in better and more innovative solutions. I recognize that all individuals bring unique and valuable perspectives to a collaborative effort and I make sure to foster a culture of inclusion and appreciation of diverse ideas and experiences.\n\nI am well-versed in creating logical and efficient user flows, ensuring that the user's experience is seamless and intuitive. I am skilled in using technologies such as React, React Native, HTML, JavaScript, and CSS to build fully responsive web applications. I love tackling complex technical challenges and am an advocate of open-source development.";
